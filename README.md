# Info In, Book Out

You can access the live site of our application by [clicking here](https://haoyangchen.github.io/iinbo/)

You can search a particular book that you want to rent/buy in the search box located at the top of the page. If you click on the categories, it will take you directly to the book search page with this specific category.

You can also make new post by first searching your book's name and author through the form. Then the search result will show up and you can select the "SELL ONE LIKE THIS" button to enter your customized description and address. Your post will then automatically be added to the page. What's more, you can also delete a post you previously added from the page.

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Development_ course at the UW iSchool. All CSS files are written in a `css/` folder, while all JavaScript files are created in a `js/` folder.

The included `test.spec.js` script will check for syntax and style errors in the `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files. Simply run the `jest` command to check this. We also use the [WAVE accessibility tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to assess the accessibility of our project at each stage.
